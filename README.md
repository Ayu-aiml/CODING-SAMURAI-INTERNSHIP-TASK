# CODING-SAMURAI-INTERNSHIP-TASK
Remote intership on machine learning using python(notebook)


# Task 1

## Predicting Flower Species
In this project, we aim to create a simple machine learning model to predict the species of flowers based on their features. We will utilize the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).


# Task 2

## Movie Recommendation System
Build a basic movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their viewing history or preferences. This project will introduce you to the concepts of collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation.
